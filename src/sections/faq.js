        On-demand grocery delivery is a service that aims to provide groceries to customers as 
        fast as possible. It adopts a tech-first approach as opposed to the traditional supermarket
        method of in-store shopping. We aim to revolutionise shopping by putting the customer first, saving 
        you time and money by taking away the pain of shopping.

      <div>
        Like many people, we have found that grocery shopping is more of a chore than something we 
        would like to do. There are many times when it is not convenient to go to the supermarket. 
        For example, we are missing a key ingredient of a dish, or we are hosting a party and can't leave. 
        Suddenly, going to the supermarket suddenly becomes a hassle. Wasting your time travelling and shopping 
        made us realise that there had to be an easier, modern 21st-century approach. This is the idea of Shopawei.

        In order to pay our riders and packers fairly for the amazing work they do, and keep up the high standard of service
