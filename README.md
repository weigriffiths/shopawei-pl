## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn upgrade
yarn dev
```

You can change the development server port on package.json by modifying <code>next dev -p {port}</code>.

Open [http://localhost:{port}]with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
